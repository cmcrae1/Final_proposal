What I plan on doing for my final project is to look at several events that have caused a dispora of people to flee their country.
I would like to analyze the number of people as well as where these people went to once they became refugees. My question will 
be something along the lines of "which causes more refugees, political instability or conflict and war.  I can find my data here at

I would like to incorporate Moran's I as well as a 3-d map, and a hexagonal grid analysis. Something that we havent used in class,
but something I would like to use on the project, is the ue of large arrows to visually represent where the migrants are fleeing to.
The number of migrants leaving a country will be displayed by color, but where they are going will be a seperate issue. I choose
arrows because it's an easy way to visually show the reader in a concise way where the migrants are fleeing to. 
I feel as though this is more involved than the lab, becasue projects like this can have farther reaching implications, and could 
actually change people's lives. Something that I learned when doing preliminary research and something that suprised me greatly,
was the sheer number of people fleeing, as well as how dispersed they ended up being. It was my assumption that 90% of them were 
on similar paths, but that couldnt be farther from the truth.
